# Project Data
Data in the `pbc` folder is obtained for 1D Bose-Hubbard models with periodic boundary conditions. 
- DMRG: Density matrix renormalization group calculations 
- QMC: Quantum Monte Carlo calculations using the lattice worm algorithm pigsfli.
- VUMPS: Variational uniform matrix product state calculations with infinite boundary conditions.

Data in the `obc` folder is obtained for 1D Bose-Hubbard models with open boundary conditions using the DMRG algorithm.
